All lecture and tutorial examples require the following in order to work:
    - Python 3.6
    - A python virtual environment
    - Flask
    - zappa
    - AWS CLI 

Perform these steps to run the examples:

1) Install python 3.6 by following the instructions for your respective platform available at https://www.python.org/

2) Download and unpack the example sources:

   a) Download the example sources,
   b) Open a shell and navigate to the location of the tar.gz file
   c) Uncompress and untar (e.g., tar -xzf solution.tar.gz)
   d) Go into the example directory (e.g., cd solution)

3) Create a new python virtual environment as follows:

   python -m venv venv

   For some platforms substitute python for python3 or python3.6

4) Activate the virtual environment

   source venv/bin/activate

5) Install Flask

   pip install flask

6) Install AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

   Follow instruction in https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

7) Install zappa

   pip install zappa
   pip3.6 install zappa==0.45.1

7) Before you can begin using zappa, you should set up authentication
credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM
Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#. You can create
or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new
set of keys.  You will need both the aws_access_key_id and
aws_secret_access_key.

8) Configure your credentials

   aws configure

9) Edit the file zappa_settings.json.  Set the value of the key "s3_bucket" to
   the name of one of your existing S3 buckets.

10) Deploy the example on AWS Lambda

   zappa deploy dev

   flask 1.0.2 has requirement Werkzeug>=0.14, but you'll have werkzeug 0.12 which is incompatible.
   cfn-flip 1.2.0 has requirement PyYAML>=3.13b1, but you'll have pyyaml 3.12 which is incompatible.

   pip install pip==9.0.1
